 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical study on employee compensation. By analyzing the relationship between Age, Professional Experience, and Annual Income, the project provides actionable insights for HR departments to optimize salary structures and improve recruitment budgeting.


Key Objectives
Correlation Analysis: Identify the statistical impact of age vs. years of experience on total earnings.

Income Benchmarking: Establish average salary expectations for different experience tiers.

Predictive Modeling: Build a foundation for a linear regression model to estimate fair market value for new hires.

Data Visualization: Create an intuitive dashboard to represent complex HR data for non-technical stakeholders.


Technologies Used
Language: Python 3.x

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights
Experience vs. Income: A strong positive correlation was found between years of experience and salary. Experience is a more reliable predictor of income than age.

Growth Trajectory: The data indicates significant salary jumps at the 5-year and 10-year experience milestones.

Clean Data: The dataset showed 0% missing values and no duplicates, ensuring high reliability for predictive modeling.
